# ATMExercise
Simple React ATM
# Description
This project explores the concept of parent and child components, managed forms, and input-validation. These concepts allow the simulation of an ATM which can handle proper inputs, withdrawals, and deposits. All while displaying the total bank balance. Future additons can include a better developed user-interface and pulling in a documentation of transactions with dates from an external source using useEffect.
